# My personal portfolio

I am attempting to learn html, css, and js to create my own portfolio. This project is not finished yet.

I am using the [last.fm api for JavaScript](https://github.com/fxb/javascript-last.fm-api) to display information about my Spotify profile on this webiste

The website can be viewed [here](https://peamupbubber.github.io/)
